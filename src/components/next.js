                    My next big plan is to dive into backend development with
                    Node JS and Mongo DB or SQL for the database so that I can
                    build fully functional web apps, also I plan to learn
                    Typescript because many jobs require it.

                    But before all that excitement, I'm hunting for my first job
                    to kickstart this journey. I'm eager to roll up my sleeves,
                    learn on the job, and grow with the right opportunity. So,
                    here I am, hoping you might be the one to give that to me.
